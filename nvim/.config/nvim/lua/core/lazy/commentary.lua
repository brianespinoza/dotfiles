-- Comment stuff out. Use gcc to comment out a line (takes a count),
-- gc to comment out the target of a motion (for example, gcap to comment out a paragraph),
-- gc in visual mode to comment out the selection, and gc in operator pending
-- mode to target a comment. You can also use it as a command, either with a
-- range like :7,17Commentary, or as part of a :global invocation like with :g/TODO/Commentary. That's it.
